Here are examples of cases where you must do more work
and then charge the student a penalty:

(1) the link command in build.sh builds a file named
testPile, not test_Pile  (The specification said the 
build.sh script must create a file with the test_Pile
name.  The grading script tried and failed to move test_Pile
from the building dir. to the testing dir.

You should manually move 
/tmp/310TA(your login)/project1/testPile
to
/tmp/310TA(your login)/_TESTING_/test_Pile
(notice the spelling correction..so the grading 
 script can run test_Pile)

When the script prompts for it, deduct 5 pts
for this and things that are similarly simple.

(2) In addition to some good looking RCS databases,
the same first student submitted a quite elaborate
and good looking log file, in which the student 
said he/she messed up with the RCS directions...
Here, give full credit for RCS.

If they give some other kind of log, but omit
the RCS databases, give full credit but write 
an comment that RCS is required for credit in 
future projects.

(3) Take off 0.5 (50%) if the student didn't
write pre/post conditions in header files in addition
to the ones I gave them.
