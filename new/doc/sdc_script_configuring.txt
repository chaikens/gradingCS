Make the GRADING DIRECTORY:
Put it under ~/private/"$Year".grading
and name it with the project name.  For example,
~/private/Spr07grading/pr1pt2
Here pr1pt2 is the PROJECT NAME.

Copy old or sample versions of the following files into the GRADING DIRECTORY:
grade_these.pl Selects submissions and runs scriptIG.pl on them one by one.
scriptIG.pl    Unpacks and performs the grading on one submission

Make sure grade_these.pl and scriptIG.pl are "executable"
using chmod 700 *.pl if necessary.

Configure grade_these.pl
Set $NAM_project to the PROJECT NAME
Set $Year to the say Spr07 (a name that distinguishes semesters)

Configure scriptIG.pl
Set $ProjectName to the PROJECT NAME

Review/edit $NonFunGradInstructions 
(for grading non-functional or process requirements)

Review/set point amounts for various non-functional requirements
If the point amount is 0, the TA will not be asked to grade the requirement.

Review $valueInteractiveTests.  For CSI310, it is normally 70.

Set Project due time and late config:
First, set the date and time in the comment.
Set $DUEhour, $DUEmon (NOTE COMMENT: January is month 0)
    $DUEmday, $DUEyear (NOTE COMMENT: 2007 is 007)

Set $DUEmaxdayslate
Set $DUEDaysPer100PercentOff (NOTE COMMENT: 1/this value is daily penalty rate)

Set Project Directory Information
$ProjGradingDir to the GRADING DIRECTORY, specify pathname under
$ClassAcctHomeDir

Make the GRADING CASES DIRECTORY and set its path in
$TestCaseDir

Set @PartsIGList (normally one entry, the project name)
Set @PartsIGexeName (normally one entry, for the executable
name that the project assignment specified.)
Check @PartsIGPoints (normally one entry, 70)
Check @PartsIGTestCaseDir



name that the project assignment specified.)
Check @PartsIGPoints (normally one entry, 70)
Check @PartsIGTestCaseDir

For multiple parts, make these lists:
@PartsIGList : a list names of parts
@PartsIGexeName :corresponding names of the executable file
@PartsIGPoints : points for each part 
@PartsIGTestCasesDir : Directories containing test cases (t01.txt, etc)

-----------------------------------------------------
Each test case must have a file named with the 
pattern *.txt in the GRADING CASES DIRECTORY.
That file MUST end with a newline.
We usually name the tests t01, t02, t10, t20, t21, etc.

The contents of the .txt file will be presented
to the grader.  The contents of the .in file will
be available to input to the program under test
when the grader commands.  The grader can supply 
other input by typing it.

If the grader doesn't fully accept the test,
a copy of the .txt file plus the input
and output to the program under test are inserted
in the report to the student.

When there is only one entry in the 
@PartsIGList, @PartsIGexeName, and
@PartsIGPoints lists, then all tests will count
equally.  (So the number of points for
each will be the only number in
@PartsIGPoints divided by the number of tests.
