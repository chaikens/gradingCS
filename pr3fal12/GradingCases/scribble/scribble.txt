We run:
Picture p = new Picture( our test file name );
p.scribble(300,300,1.0 ); p.show();

-10/80=-.125 (or 0.875) 
if it's white in the middle and orig. colors at the corners.

-20/80=-.250 (or 0.75)
Uniform or almost uniform grey, or a weird color gradation.

-40/80=-.5 (or 0.5)
all black or all white.

TA: To work cleanly, TYPE ANY LETTER and enter after looking
for or at the picture.  Then enter rating.
